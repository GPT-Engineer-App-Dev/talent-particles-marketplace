# talent-particles-marketplace

Implement a landing page for a marketplace called Particles that connects companies with software talent specializing in web technologies. The page should have the following sections:

- Hero section with a headline and subheading that clearly explains the value proposition 
- Features section highlighting the key benefits, such as being able to find pre-vetted talent, filter by technology, and message developers
- Call-to-action button to view the developer listings

Use a modern, professional design with a tech-focused color scheme. Include relevant imagery related to software development and collaboration.
